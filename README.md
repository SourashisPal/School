# School

I am Sourashis Pal  
I study in **Convent of Jesus and Mary High School, Ranaghat, High School**  
**Computer Applications using Java** is a part of our curriculum

This repository contains the source code of an IntelliJ IDEA Project which has all our school assignments and questions asked by students  
I use this to share the project between devices as well to share with others

## Build

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SourashisPal/school.git
```

- Clone the repository using this command
- Open the project in any IDE or compile manually

**Or**

- Some IDEs may have direct cloning from VCS

This project is not configured to be built by any build tool such as Ant, Maven or Gradle  
It is kept as simple as possible
